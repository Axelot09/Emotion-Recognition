# Emotion-Recognition

The project is an advanced emotion recognition software developed in Python, utilizing computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions in real-time. The software detects and tracks faces within a video feed or image, drawing bounding boxes around each detected face. It then processes the facial features to identify and display the emotion being portrayed, such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise.
